## Question 1

**Compare and contrast the data types used for:**

- `country.Population`
- `country.LifeExpectancy`

Why were these data typesiiii selected?

### Data type  for Population is "int" and for LifeExpectancy is "decimal 3,1."
Because we are dealing with human beings, the count must be a whole number. Since life expectancy is a calculated average it will usually always be a decimal. The precision and scale limit values to have to be betwwen 0.0 and 99.9.

### Screenshot

_Show the table structure or DESCRIBE output._

```sql
DESCRIBE country;
```
